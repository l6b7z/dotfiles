## lf

console file manager

I programmed a lot of functionality into it and 
I still have plenty of improvements in mind

It saved me more time than I put into it already 
because any operation can be acomplished with a few keystrokes  

## mpv

mpv video player, with plenty of modification it also serves

as an audio player, image viewer or music player

has a lot of extended functionalities and plenty of room to add new

I am happy with the result its size is aprox 50MiB
but it has the functionality comparable to similar programs
